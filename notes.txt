ORIENTATION TO DATASCIENCESTAR
- I have just been employed at DataScienceStar and one of the first things I'm doing is attending the compulsory
  python orientation session! These are some of the things I learnt:

  1) Dictionaries
  - A way to store a value so that it can be retrieved by using a specific name (key)
  - The all important SYNTAX!!!!!
        empty_dict = {} # To initialize a dict
        full_dict = {"height": 1.72, "weight":79} # Creating a dict with values
        height = full_dict['height'] # Getting a value using its name (key)
        key in dict # To check whether a key is in the dictionary
        dict.items() # Returns a list of tuples (key, value) that contain the key and value of an item in the dict
  
  - defaultdict is a version of a dictionary where if you try looking up a key that doesn't exist it adds the 
    key to the dict with a value. The value comes from a function given when creating the defaultdict. The function
    can't have arguements
  - Let's look at an example!!!
        from collections import defaultdict
        word_counts = defaultdict(int)  # int() returns 0
        list_dict = defaultdict(list) # list() returns an empty list
        # The Roman Guess says that maybe its useful when you always want the same value returned if a key does not exist
          and you don't want to check every time whether a key exists or not

  2) Counters
  - A Counter turns an iterable e.g a list into a dictionary. The keys in the dictionary are the unique items
    in the iterable and the values are the number of times the item has appeared in the iterable.
  - Good for when you want to get the count of items
  - As always let's see an example:
        from collections import Counter
        c = Counter([0, 0, 1,0, 2, 3]) # c is {0:3, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1}
  - Counters have a most_common(x) method that returns the x most common entries in the Counter as a list of tuples


  3) Sets
  - A list of unique items
  - SYNTAX!!!!
        my_set = {1, 2 ,3 ,4}
        empty_set = set() # only way to make an empty set as {} means an empty dict
        empty_set.add(3)
  - Sets are useful because testing for membership is very fast(faster than lists) and is useful for getting 
    distinct elements in a collection


  4) Iterables and Generators
  - Let's say you have a list that has a billion elements but you only want to get the first 5 elements. It'd be wasteful to create
    the whole list, store in memory to only use the first 5.
  - In another scenario, if we only need one element from the time it'd still be wasteful to load the entire list but only use the
    elements once and never again.
  - This can be solved using generators which will return one element from an iterable every time it is called
  - EXAMPLE!!!!!!
        # Iterate over numbers from 1 to n
        # Create the generator
        def generate_range(n):
            i = 0
            while i < n:
                yield i 
                i += 1
        # Using values in generator
        for i in generate_range(10):
            print(i)


  5) Randomness
  - Randomness is achieved using the random package
  - EXAMPLES!!!!
        import random
        random.random() # Generates a random number between 0 and 1
        random.randrange(x, [y]) # Generates a random number between 0 and xx if y is not specified and between x and y if y is specified
        random.shuffle(list) # Randomly shuffles the elements in a list
        random.choice(list) # Randomly pick an element from a list
        random.sample(list, x) # Randomly pick x unique elements from list

 
  6) Type Annotation
  - Allows your editor to auto complete things more since it knows the type of your arguements
  - The typing module allows us to be more specific with the typing of things
  - Example!!!!!
        from typing import List
        def f(xs:List[int]) -> int: # Without typing module we cannot specify that we want a list of ints
            return sum(xs)
